                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A agent-based emergence simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem. The project was made using Unreal Engine 5 and C++ as my final project for CPSC 565: Emergent Computing. In the class, we
                        were taught about emergence and how it can be used to create complex systems from simple rules. We were tasked with coming up with a project that demonstrated the principles of emergence, creating
                        a proposal, and then implementing it. I created Kingdom of Predators with the aim of exploring whether an agent-based simulation could be used to create believable actors to see the viability of
                        using such a system in games and other simulations.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Pathfinder, a project I made over the summer of 2022 to learn and implement pathfinding algorithms, specifically BFS and DFS. I had learned them for the first time a
                        a year ago or so and had forgotten them over time. So, I came up with a project to work on which would help me practice and understand the algorithms.
                        The project was made using Unity 3D and C#, and I relearned the algorithms using MIT OCW.
