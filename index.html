                        This is Pathfinder, a project I made over the summer of 2022 to learn and implement pathfinding algorithms, specifically BFS and DFS. I had learned them for the first time a
                        a year ago or so and had forgotten them over time. So, I came up with a project to work on which would help me practice and understand the algorithms.
                        The project was made using Unity 3D and C#, and I relearned the algorithms using MIT OCW.

                        This is KorEscape, a game my group and I made for Art 503 during the Winter semester of 2022. It was made using the Unity Engine and C#.
                        To get a proper breakdown of all the features in the game you can download the game design document from above. All of the programming and
                        implementation (setting up animations, setting up the map layout, etc.) were exclusively my responsibility.

                        This is a game made for the GDN 2021 Game Jam over the course of 4-days that was actively worked on
                        by myself and one other person in Europe who I met online for the purpose of the game jam. We both worked on it
                        remotely using Unity 3D, C# and GitHub. This was my first time working with another person on a game jam as well
                        as working with Unity 3D.
