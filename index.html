                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ÄÉAn agent-based emergence simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem made in Unreal Engine 5 with C++ as my final project for CPSC 565: Emergent Computing class. This project was completely planned, designed, and implemented by me. Notably, the creatures' decisions are solely composed of information they can collect. In other words, there is no external data being transferred into the creatures; rather, the creatures are looking and listening to collect their own data. Here‚Äôs where the emergence comes in: all the creatures are relatively simple, but as a consequence of many of them acting together, more complex behaviors emerge. <br><br>
                    
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project aimed to see whether agent-based simulation could be used to create believable actors and assess the viability of using such a system in games and other simulations. The hope was that emergence-based behavior would prove to be a viable solution for making virtual worlds feel alive and not mechanical. The project was largely a success; however, further exploration needs to be done to assess the viability of such agents in virtual worlds beyond simulation. <br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project was made using Unreal Engine 5 and C++, and no blueprints were used. The StateTrees plugin was used to implement the creature AI.
